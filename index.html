                        JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and perators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax
                        is based on the Java and C languages, many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports 
                        object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes. JavaScript also supports functional programming because
                        they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object.
